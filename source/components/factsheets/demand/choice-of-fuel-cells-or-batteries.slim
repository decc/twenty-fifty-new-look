<h1>Choice of fuel cells or batteries</h1>In 2007, almost all domestic vehicles were powered by diesel or petrol engines. Between now and 2050, it is anticipated that the percentage of zero emission vehicles (such as battery electric or hydrogen fuel cell vehicles) in the domestic vehicle fleet (cars, motorcycles, vans and buses) will increase.The 'Shift to zero emission transport' slider allows users to specify the proportion of zero emission vehicles in the domestic vehicle fleet. Options A to D allow the user to choose the proportion of those vehicles that would be either fully electric, or hydrogen fuel cells. In practice other technologies such as 'hybrid' electric-hydrogen vehicles (hydrogen fuel cell range extender) could exist, using all-electric for short journeys and hydrogen for long journeys. However, the Calculator currently only models fully battery electric or hydrogen fuel cell vehicles.<p class="subtitle">Option A</p>Option A assumes that by 2050, 100% of zero emission domestic vehicles will be fully electric.<p class="subtitle">Option B</p>Option B assumes that by 2050, 80% of zero emission electric vehicles will be fully electric, and 20% will have hydrogen fuel cells.<p class="subtitle">Option C</p>Option C assumes that by 2050, 20% of zero emission domestic vehicles will be fully electric and 80% of vehicles will have hydrogen fuel cells.<p class="subtitle">Option D</p>Option D assumes that by 2050, all zero emission domestic vehicles will be powered by hydrogen fuel cells.<p class="subtitle">Interaction with other choices</p>The level of transport electrification selected in the 'Shift to zero emission transport' slider and the assumptions about 'Domestic Transport Behaviour' will influence the overall numbers of electric and hydrogen fuel cell cars and vans on the road.Selecting any of Options A to D does not impact on the other technologies included in the 'Shift to zero emissions transport' slider which includes conventional and plug-in hybrid cars, buses, trains and aviation and shipping.<img class="aligncenter " src="/images/factsheets/choice-of-fuel-cells-or-batteries-img.png" alt="Choice of fuel cells or batteries" /><p class="figure">Figure 1.
