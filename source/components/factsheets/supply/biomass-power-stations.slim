<h1>Biomass power stations</h1>In 2009 the UK had 400 MW capacity of dedicated biomass plants, and 255 MW capacity of biomass co-firing plants, which can burn both coal and biomass. If these plants were running 90% of the time and using just energy crops, it would require around 1700 km2 of land to grow the fuel on, if it all came from purpose-grown energy crops.<p class="subtitle">Level 1</p>Level 1 assumes dedicated biomass plants reach an installed capacity of 600 MW by 2010 and remain at that level until 2050, delivering 4.7 TWh/y of electricity.<p class="subtitle">Level 2</p>Level 2 assumes that 180 MW of biomass power plants are built or converted from coal plants every year, reaching 3 GW of installed capacity in 2025 and just under 8 GW by 2050. This is equivalent to a third of the current coal power station fleet and generates 62 TWh/y of electricity. The biomass power plants require solid biomass amounting to 16 times the UK's current use, and if this were all from purpose-grown energy crops they could cover an area the size of Wales.<p class="subtitle">Level 3</p>Level 3 assumes there is a sustained build/conversion rate of biomass plants just above the historical maximum rates in Sweden and Italy for every year from 2010 to 2050. The installed capacity reaches 5 GW in 2025 and over 12 GW by 2050. This is roughly equivalent to half the UK's current fleet of coal power stations and generates about 100 TWh/y of electricity. These biomass power stations use up to 26 times more solid biomass than we do today, which could be sourced from 32 000 km2 of land, or 1.5 times the area of Wales.<p class="subtitle">Level 4</p>Level 4 assumes that the UK constructs a fleet of biomass power stations roughly equivalent to the current coal power stations' installed capacity of 23 GW. Total capacity reaches 8 GW in 2025 and over 22 GW by 2050. Based on the size of today's average power stations, this requires over 500 dedicated biomass power stations or 11 coal-plant-sized equivalents. The power stations use just under the maximum available solid biomass of 535 TWh/y, representing 58 000 km2 of energy crops, an area nearly 3 times the size of Wales. After efficiency and processing losses, these biomass power stations produce nearly 180 TWh/y of electricity output.<img class="aligncenter" src="/images/factsheets/biomass-power-stations-img.png" alt="Biomass power stations" /><p class="figure">Figure 1.
