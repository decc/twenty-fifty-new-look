<h1>Livestock and their management</h1>In 2007, there were over 220 million livestock animals, including nearly 2 million dairy cows. The 2050 Calculator contains two options relating to agricultural biomass and land use: livestock management (described here) and land use management (described on another page).<p class=\"subtitle\">Level 1</p>Level 1 assumes that, by 2050, domestic food production takes priority imports, with livestock numbers increased by 10% over 2010 levels. This means approximately 200 000 more cows grazing on UK grass in 2050.<p class=\"subtitle\">Level 2</p>Level 2 assumes that current trends and drivers in land management continue from now to 2050, with an increasing area of land covered by housing. However the area planted with bioenergy crops also increases, so that five times more energy crops are produced in 2050 than today. The resulting energy available in 2050 is 117 TWh/y.<p class=\"subtitle\">Level 3</p>Level 3 assumes that livestock numbers reduce by 10% by 2050. This is effectively the converse of level 1, and means there are approximately 200 000 fewer cows in the UK by 2050.<p class=\"subtitle\">Level 4</p>Level 4 assumes a significant shift away from livestock production in the UK, potentially caused by us eating less meat, by switching from beef to less land-intensive meats such as chicken, or increasing the agricultural focus on bioenergy. Livestock numbers decline by 25% on 2010 levels, equivalent to 390 000 fewer cows by 2050.<img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"/images/factsheets/livestock-and-their-management-img.png\" alt=\"Land dedicated to bioenergy\" /><p class=\"figure\">Figure 1.
